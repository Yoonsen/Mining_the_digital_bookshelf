<h2>Preface to the Electronic Edition</h2>

<p>This electronic edition was produced in 1998 by Ingrid Clareus
(editing, proofreading) and Lars Aronsson (scanning, HTML markup).  It
is copied from the 1971 edition, with omission of the introduction by
Karin Westman Berg, which is still covered by copyright.  The text
uses modern, post-1906 Swedish spelling, but old plural forms of the
verbs.  Hyphenated words in the printed copy have been joined in the
electronic edition.

<p><i>Hertha</i> was first published in 1856.  New editions in Swedish
have appeared in 1913, 1923, 1971, and 1986.  The novel has also been
translated to several other languages.
